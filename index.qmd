Hi everyone! I'm Tingjun Chen, a first-year master's student in the Department of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 

I’m originally from Huzhou, China, and I achieved my Bachelor’s degree in Animal Science at Zhejiang University.

Outside of academics, I enjoy traveling, playing the violin, and playing basketball.
