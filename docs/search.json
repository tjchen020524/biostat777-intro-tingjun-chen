This removes players with limited sample sizes and focuses the analysis on established contributors.\nI then created several calculated variables to better understand shooting patterns. The three-point rate metric normalizes attempts per 10 minutes of playing time, allowing for fair comparisons between starters and bench players. I also grouped positions into three categories: Guards (PG and SG), Forwards (SF and PF), and Centers (C). This simplification helps reveal broader positional trends without getting lost in the nuances of hybrid positions.\n\n\nCode\nnba_filtered &lt;- nba_data %&gt;%\n  filter(MP &gt;= 25, G &gt;= 50)\n\nnba_enhanced &lt;- nba_filtered %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    three_point_rate = TPA / (MP / 10),\n    scoring_efficiency = PTS / FG_pct,\n    position_group = case_when(\n      Pos %in% c(\"PG\", \"SG\") ~ \"Guards\",\n      Pos %in% c(\"SF\", \"PF\") ~ \"Forwards\",\n      Pos == \"C\" ~ \"Centers\"\n    )\n  )\n\nposition_stats &lt;- nba_enhanced %&gt;%\n  group_by(position_group) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    avg_3PA = mean(TPA, na.rm = TRUE),\n    avg_3P_pct = mean(TP_pct, na.rm = TRUE),\n    avg_PTS = mean(PTS, na.rm = TRUE),\n    player_count = n()\n  )\n\ntop_shooters &lt;- nba_enhanced %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(TPA)) %&gt;%\n  select(Player, Pos, TPA, TP_pct, PTS)\n\nshooting_metrics &lt;- nba_enhanced %&gt;%\n  select(Player, position_group, TPA, TP_pct) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(TPA, TP_pct),\n    names_to = \"metric\",\n    values_to = \"value\"\n  )"

    "section": "Results",
    "text": "Results\n\nPositional Differences in Three-Point Shooting\nThe first analysis examines how different position groups approach three-point shooting. As shown in Figure 1, guards clearly lead the league in perimeter attempts, averaging 6.7 three-point shots per game. Forwards sit in the middle at 4.8 attempts, while centers lag far behind at just 1.1 attempts per game. This stark difference reflects the fundamental roles each position plays in modern NBA offenses, with guards serving as primary floor spacers and centers maintaining their traditional interior focus.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(position_stats, aes(x = position_group, y = avg_3PA, fill = position_group)) +\n  geom_col(width = 0.7) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = round(avg_3PA, 1)), vjust = -0.5, size = 5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Average Three-Point Attempts by Position\",\n    subtitle = \"2023-24 NBA Season (Players with 25+ MPG, 50+ Games)\",\n    x = \"Position Group\",\n    y = \"Average 3-Point Attempts per Game\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Basketball Reference | Analysis shows Guards dominate perimeter shooting\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Three-point attempts vary significantly by position, with guards leading the modern NBA offense\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantKey Finding\n\n\n\nGuards average 6.7 three-point attempts per game, more than six times the rate of centers at 1.1 attempts. This reflects the strategic shift in modern NBA basketball toward perimeter-oriented offense (Goldsberry 2023).\n\n\n\n\nThe Volume-Accuracy Trade-off\nA key question in basketball analytics is whether high-volume shooting compromises accuracy. The scatter plot below explores this relationship, with each point representing a player and the bubble size indicating their scoring output. The trend line shows a slight negative correlation, but many high-volume shooters maintain strong percentages. Players like Stephen Curry and Damian Lillard demonstrate that it’s possible to take 9-11 three-pointers per game while shooting above 35%, challenging the traditional notion that volume necessarily hurts efficiency.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(nba_enhanced, aes(x = TPA, y = TP_pct, color = position_group, linewidth = PTS)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE, linetype = \"dashed\", color = \"black\", linewidth = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Three-Point Shooting: Volume vs Accuracy\",\n    subtitle = \"Bubble size represents points per game\",\n    x = \"Three-Point Attempts per Game\",\n    y = \"Three-Point Percentage (%)\",\n    color = \"Position\",\n    size = \"PPG\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Basketball Reference | Higher volume shooters maintain competitive accuracy\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\")\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Players who attempt more three-pointers show varied efficiency, highlighting the balance between volume and accuracy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition-Specific Scoring Patterns\nThe faceted visualization below breaks down the relationship between scoring and rebounding across the three position groups. Each panel tells a different story about how these positions contribute to team success. Guards show high scoring with low rebounding, consistent with their perimeter-oriented roles. Forwards demonstrate balanced contributions in both areas. Centers dominate the glass while scoring efficiently, though generally at lower volumes than perimeter players. The color gradient by age reveals that elite production isn’t limited to any particular age group, with both veterans and young stars excelling.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(nba_enhanced, aes(x = PTS, y = TRB, color = Age)) +\n  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.7) +\n  facet_wrap(~position_group, scales = \"free\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Points vs Rebounds by Position Group\",\n    subtitle = \"Color represents player age - examining veteran vs young player performance\",\n    x = \"Points per Game\",\n    y = \"Total Rebounds per Game\",\n    color = \"Age\",\n    caption = \"Data source: Basketball Reference | Centers dominate rebounding while Guards lead scoring\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n  scale_color_gradient(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Detailed comparison of scoring and rebounding by position reveals distinct playing styles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeague Leaders in Three-Point Shooting\nThe table below lists the top three-point shooters by volume. Notice that point guards and shooting guards dominate the top 10, with only a few forwards breaking into the elite tier. Stephen Curry leads the league with 11.4 attempts per game while maintaining an impressive 40.8% accuracy. This combination of volume and efficiency has redefined what’s possible in perimeter shooting.\n\n\nCode\nhead(top_shooters, 10) %&gt;%\n  kable(digits = 1, col.names = c(\"Player\", \"Position\", \"3PA/G\", \"3P%\", \"PPG\"))\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Leading three-point shooters in the 2023-24 season\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlayer\nPosition\n3PA/G\n3P%\nPPG\n\n\n\n\nStephen Curry\nPG\n11.4\n40.8\n26.4\n\n\nDamian Lillard\nPG\n9.5\n35.4\n24.3\n\n\nDonovan Mitchell\nSG\n8.7\n36.8\n27.1\n\n\nTrae Young\nPG\n8.4\n37.3\n25.7\n\n\nLuka Doncic\nPG\n8.2\n38.2\n33.9\n\n\nJayson Tatum\nSF\n8.2\n37.6\n26.9\n\n\nAnthony Edwards\nSG\n7.0\n35.7\n25.9\n\n\nLauri Markkanen\nPF\n6.8\n39.9\n23.2\n\n\nJaylen Brown\nSG\n6.3\n36.0\n23.0\n\n\nDevin Booker\nSG\n5.8\n36.4\n27.1"

    "text": "Summary\nThis analysis reveals the profound impact of the three-point revolution in modern NBA basketball. Guards have fully embraced perimeter shooting, averaging 6.7 three-point attempts per game compared to just 1.1 for centers. Despite the high volume, elite shooters maintain accuracy above 35%, demonstrating that the strategic shift toward three-point shooting is both efficient and effective. The data shows clear positional specialization, with guards serving as primary perimeter threats while centers focus on interior scoring and rebounding. These findings align with broader trends in basketball analytics (Oliver 2024), which emphasize the mathematical advantage of three-point shooting. The modern NBA has successfully integrated high-volume three-point shooting without sacrificing efficiency, fundamentally transforming the game’s strategic landscape."
