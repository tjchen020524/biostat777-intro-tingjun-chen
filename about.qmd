## 🎻 Hobbies

I’m really passionate about music and have been playing the violin for 16 years. During college, I was part of the orchestra and took part in many performances, which was an amazing experience. I also enjoy playing basketball and watching the NBA. My favorite team is the Golden State Warriors, and I’m a big fan of Stephen Curry. I love traveling as well, especially going hiking in nature or exploring new cities.
